Lecture Notes and Problem Sets in 10.426/10.626 ({{% resource_link "619c45d2-ab2c-4246-8776-08a529a02b7c" "PDF - 45.9MB" %}}): Lectures were composed and delivered by Professor Martin Bazant with additional lectures by Dr. Zongyu (Joey) Gu, Lecturer in Chemical Engineering. Lecture notes were transcribed by the students as homework assignments. Problem sets and exams from the course are included in chronological order without solutions. Undergraduate students in 10.426 attended the same lectures as graduate students in 10.626, but completed only selected homework and exam problems. This file is compiled and edited by Alec Agee, the teaching assistance of this course.
