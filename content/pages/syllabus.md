## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 1.5 hours / session, 2 sessions / week

## Prerequisites

[*10.302 Transport Processes*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/10-302-transport-processes-fall-2004/)

## Course Description

This course introduces principles and mathematical models of electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Students study equivalent circuits, thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, transport phenomena, electrostatics, porous media, and phase transformations. In addition, this course includes applications to batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and electrokinetics.

## Grading

- Homework (weekly): 40%
- Scribe notes (once): 10%
- Midterm exam (take-home): 20%
- Final exam: 30%

Exams: The mid-term exam is a take-home exam; the final exam is a three-hour open-book open-notes exam.

Homework: Graduate students (10.626) will get different and/or additional problems for homework and exams than undergraduates (10.426). Solutions must show all derivation steps and clear written arguments for full credit. Each student will “scribe” lecture notes once, creating text and figures, due within a week the after lecture.

Collaboration policy: You are encouraged to work on problem sets with other students in the class, but you must turn in your own original written solutions and list any collaborators. You must work alone on the take-home exam; you may consult any books or online resources, but not other people. Computer or smartphone use is not permitted during the final exam, but hardcopies of books and notes may be consulted.

## Readings

Required readings will include selected lecture notes from previous semesters of the course, as well as research articles, assigned throughout the semester and chapters from the following textbooks:
